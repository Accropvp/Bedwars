# Bedwars
 I created a bedwars similar to the hypixel one

# How to start
 First create compatible teams
the compatible team name are :
    -RED
    -BLUE
    -GREEN
    -YELLOW
    -CYAN
    -WHITE
    -PINK
    -GRAY

then set the spawnpoint of each player.
then execute the command "/startbedwars" and you should be good to go.

# How to make a map
 to make the spawn you have to use command:
    for diamond spawner do "/diamondSpawnPoint <x> <y> <z>", where "DIAMOND SPAWNER" is key tag
    for emerald spawner do "/emeraldSpawnPoint <x> <y> <z>", where "EMERALD SPAWNER" is key tag
    for team forge do "/forgeSpawnPoint <x> <y> <z> <team>", where <team> is the key tag
to make a team bed you need to tag it by doing the command: "/tagbed <x> <y> <z> <team>", where the location is the key tag
you can remove tag by doing: /removeTag <tag>
you can change the radius of the effect like trap or heal pool by executing the command "/upgradeRadius <radius>"
