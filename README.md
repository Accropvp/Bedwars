# Bedwars
 I created a bedwars similar to the hypixel one

# How to start
 First create compatible teams <br>
the compatible team name are : <br>
    -RED <br>
    -BLUE <br>
    -GREEN <br>
    -YELLOW <br>
    -CYAN <br>
    -WHITE <br>
    -PINK <br>
    -GRAY <br>

then set the spawnpoint of each player. <br>
then execute the command "/startbedwars" and you should be good to go.

# How to make a map
 to make the spawn you have to use command: <br>
    for diamond spawner do `"/diamondSpawnPoint <x> <y> <z>"`, where "DIAMOND SPAWNER" is key tag <br>
    for emerald spawner do `"/emeraldSpawnPoint <x> <y> <z>"`, where "EMERALD SPAWNER" is key tag <br>
    for team forge do `"/forgeSpawnPoint <x> <y> <z> <team>"`, where `<team>` is the key tag <br>
to make a team bed you need to tag it by doing the command: `"/tagbed <x> <y> <z> <team>"`, where the location is the key tag <br>
you can remove tag by doing: `"/removeTag <tag>"` <br>
you can change the radius of the effect like trap or heal pool by executing the command `"/upgradeRadius <radius>"` <br>
